They are also portrayed in a Tom Merry print of 18 December 1886, 'Scenes of the Liberal Union. Incorrigibles discharged' (Wellcome Library no. 565060i). In view of the mention of \"union\", they might be Liberal Unionists who broke away from the Liberals in 1886, but they do not resemble the best known Unionists such as Lord Hartington or Goschen"
