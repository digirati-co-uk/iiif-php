      "value": "The watercolour shows a rural medical practitioner, a woman, not young, using her own urine to create a medicine which she offers for sale for rubbing on the eyes to dispel bad humours of the eye. She urinates in the right foreground into a funnel over a chemical vessel; another, younger woman urinates in the left background into a funnel placed in a barrel, and a cat urinates in the left foreground on to the ground\n\n\"Humours in the eyes\" which are mentioned on the signboard seem to have been a kind of disease, possibly cataract. The recipe book of Deborah Bragge (also called Deborah Branch), Wellcome Library MS 1343, has a recipe \"For a homour in the eyes. Take a popey head break it into half a pint of watter Lett it be ready to boil then take it off and dape the eyes with it it curred Dr Trotters childs eyes for a homour that fell in them after the small pox\"  (fol. 79r)"
